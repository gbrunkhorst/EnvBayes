    "## Uncertainty in Environmental Analysis\n",
    "Understanding uncertainty is a key component of environmental science.  Repeated chemical measurements can vary by an order of magnitude.  Environmental conditions vary in space and in time.  Soil is heterogeous.  Storms and flooding constantly change environmental conditions.  Geochemical reactions are nonlinear.  Phase transitions occur.  Laboratory procedures are accurate to within a margin of error.  Left-censored (i.e., non-detect) data are common.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Environmental scientists are intimately aware of the uncertainties that confront them, however, uncertainties are not evaluated or communicated in a common way.  Uncertainties may be handled by sensitivity analyses, qualitative caveats, or rounding.  Confidence intervals are presented for simple analyses (e.g., univariate distributions), but not for more complicated calculations.  \"Multiple lines of evidence\" are often evaluated to reduce uncertainty, but these lines of evidence are usually considered separately rather than in a common model.    \n",
    "\n",
    "Bayesian computation offers a way to coherently estimate uncertainty in environmental modeling and statistics, by composing with probabilities.  Moreover, while sophisticated mathematics and algorithms are needed to fit Bayesian models, most of these details are not needed for the average scientist.  The main requirement is the ability to think probabilistically."
